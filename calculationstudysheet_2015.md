# Demo Problems on Moles, Molarity, and Dilutions


## Calculating moles
Definition/Usage: 6.02 x 10^23(Avogadro's number)amount of a substance 
Equation: grams of substance/molecular mass=mole

### Examples

## Calculating Formula Weight/ Molecular Mass
Definition/Usage:The Atomic Mass tells us how many grams of that atom is equal to one mole.
Equation:

### Examples

## Calculating Molarity
Definition/Usage: 
Equation: number of moles of substance/volume (liters) solute=molarity
one molar solution is defined as one mole of solute in one liter of water.
### Examples

## Calculating Dilutions
Definition/Usage: Used to dilute the original(stock solution)concentration into a working concentration.
Equation: original concentration X original volume=final concentration x final volume (c1v1=c2v2)

### Examples
